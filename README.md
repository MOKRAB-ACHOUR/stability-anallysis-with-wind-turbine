Problem  and  work  plan: Wind turbines occupy an important part of decentralized production and
therefore  influence  the  stability  of  the  network  to  which  they  are  connected.  Indeed,  the  electric
power produced by the wind turbine is fluctuating. It varies suddenly due to a rapid variation in wind
speed.  This  can  be  considered  as  a  disturbance  on  the  power  injected  into  the  network  and  can
endanger the stability of the network. In addition, wind turbines modify the structure of the network,
this modification changes the dynamic behavior of machines following a disturbance such as a short
circuit. The advantage of studying stability in electrical distribution networks is to estimate the impact
of  decentralized  production  on the  dynamic  behavior  of the  network  and  to try  to  find  solutions  to
improve these behaviors. The property of interconnected synchronous machines is that they rotate at
the same synchronism speed. This is called the stability of the angle of the rotor of the synchronous
machine.  The  multi-machine  electrical  system  is  stable  if  it  is  able  to  maintain  the  synchronism  of
these machines when a disturbance appears. In the case where the disturbance is strong, the stability
is  called  transient.  The  multimachine  system  is  described  by  nonlinear  differential  equations.  This
stability can be analyzed by direct methods. On the other hand, for a weak disturbance, it is the term
dynamic stability which indicates the phenomenon of synchronization. Dynamic stability is otherwise
called  the  stability  of  small  oscillations  given  the  amplitude  of  the  oscillations  produced  in  the
system. These oscillations originate from a variation of a load connected to the network. In this case,
the  multimachine  electrical  system  can  be  described  by  linear  equations  and  controlled  by  a  linear
control  method to  improve these dynamic  behaviors The main objective of this research  work is to
conduct a study on the impacts of the integration of wind production on stability, all the more so as
the  increase  in  the  penetration  rate  of  distributed  production  makes  it  more  difficult  to  maintain
synchronism between the different parts of the electricity network. Consequently, this work aims to
assess  the  potential  effects  of the  integration  of  wind  generators on the  transient  stability  of  power
electrical systems with particular reference to the distribution system.
